for Marine Biology](http://www.usb.br/cbm/) of the [University of SÃ£o
Paulo](http://www.usp.br/) (CEBIMar/USP) to share photos and videos produced by
past and current research projects and teaching activities in the center. The
content is annotated with accurate scientific information such as taxonomic
classification, life stage, geolocation, references, and other tags, and can be
